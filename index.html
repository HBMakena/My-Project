        <div class="About me">
            <P>Am a twenty four year old graduate from <strong>The University of Nairobi</strong> with a Bachelor Degree in <em>Economics.</em> My family comprises of four children of which all are girls and am the second born.
            Programming for me was not an interest from the beginning but as time passed i came to learn more about it from the movies, people and the internet and decided o try it out.
        After the few class have attended so far, have learnt alot and am loving every bit of it. It is alittle bit more than i expected honestly but am loving it.</p>
