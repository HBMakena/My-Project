            <ol>
                <li><em>Favorite Things</em></li>
                <p>THis is a project i created to describe and tell more about my favorite thing. My favorite thing is more of my pet, and my pet is a dog. I have a chihuahua called rubby.
    I got rubby when she was 1 week old and its a decision i dont regret since she has been more of a friend and companion than just a pet that you keep around.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <P>Am a twenty four year old graduate from <strong>The University of Nairobi</strong> with a Bachelor Degree in <em>Economics.</em> My family comprises of four children of which all are girls and am the second born.
    Programming for me was not an interest from the beginning but as time passed i came to learn more about it from the movies, people and the internet and decided o try it out.
